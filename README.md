# Scientifica-2021-D3CRYP747H0N-Mock
Hackathon project for the mock round of the Computer Science event, D3CRYP747H0N in NPS Indiranagar's Scientifica 2021 fest

This project is built by Siddhant Attavar, Harshit Bansal and Mahika Neranjen. It is based off [this project](https://github.com/SiddhantAttavar/2048-AI). It is a clone of the popular game 2048. The goal of the game is to combine tiles to form a tile of the same value. The game is played on a 4x4 grid. The tiles are represented by a 2-digit number. The tile with the highest value on the board is worth the most points. The goal of the game is to reach the highest score possible. The game is over when there are no more valid moves. The game is won when the highest tile reaches 2048. This project consists of times:
 - Play the game yourself and try to beat your high score
 - Let the bot play the game
