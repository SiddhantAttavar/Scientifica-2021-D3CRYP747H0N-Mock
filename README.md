# Scientifica-2021-D3CRYP747H0N-Mock
Hackathon project for the mock round of the Computer Science event, D3CRYP747H0N in NPS Indiranagar's Scientifica 2021 fest

This project was created by Siddhant Attavar, Harshit Bansal and Mahika Neranjen. It is based off [this project](https://github.com/SiddhantAttavar/2048-AI). This project is a re-implementation of the popular game 2048. This game is played on a 4x4 grid. The goal of the game is to combine tiles of the same value to form a new tile with a value equal to their sum. Each such move adds the value of the new tile to the score. The goal of the game is to reach the highest score possible. The game is over when there are no more valid moves possible. There are two modes for this game:
 - Play the game yourself and try to beat your high score
 - Let the bot play the game and see how far it can get
